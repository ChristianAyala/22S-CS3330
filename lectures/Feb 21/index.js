/**
 * Welcome to Javascript!!
 * Before starting, be sure to install node if you haven't already: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
 * To make sure it installed correctly, open a terminal and enter the command:
 * 
 * node
 * 
 * You should then see a "Welcome to Node.js" prompt. To exit the node session and go back to the terminal, type:
 * 
 * .exit
 * 
 * (Note the period at the start of the command).
 * 
 * To run this entire script in one go, cd into this directory and run:

 * node index.js
 * 
 * Node is an interpreted language that runs on the V8 engine. The same one that powers the Chrome browser.
 * There is no main() function in JS files. Anything at the top level of the file is parsed and executed
 * as if it were in main().
 * 
 * Let's start with the basics: variables.
 * JS variables are LOOSELY TYPED, which means their type is _inferred_ by the runtime and _can change_
 * during program execution. To declareÂ a variable there are two parts: the name of the variable and the
 * access modifier. A third part is optional, and that is the initial assignment.
