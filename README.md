# CS 3330 - Database Concepts
### Author - Prof. Christian Ayala
### Originally drafted Spring 2022

Welcome! This repo contains code samples and course materials for the CS 3330 course at SMU.
I will be referencing material in this repository during class, so you can always come to
class and pull the latest version of master and easily follow along. Ad-hoc queries done
in class (e.g. in response to questions) will be added to the notes file for the day and
committed to the repository as well.

This repository is NOT meant to be a comprehensive set of content presented in class,
but rather a supplement. Certain concepts, in particular DB theory, may not be present
in this repo.
